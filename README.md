# Contributing

Before you get started, it might help to read about [Visual Studio Code development containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Then, after installing the [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers) extension, open this repository in a development container and run `yarn dev` once inside.
