/**
 * @description This file is a place holder so people looking for where /core imports "deps.ts" can come here. This file exists to explain:
 * The 'core' folder is linked to by both the client and server, and the "deps.ts" file is sought after outside of the directory so that
 * the client and server implementations can supply a custom source for dependencies, since deno uses URLs and typescript uses NPM.
 * 
 * Please go to /client/src/libcore/deps.ts and /server/src/libcore/deps.ts for the implementation of this file.
